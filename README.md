# From JavaScript to Jupyter
Here are resources that Iâ€™m using to learn Jupyter, data science, mapping, and Jupyter widget development.

## Foundations
### Data science + Jupyter + Python
- [Getting Started With Jupyter Notebook for Python](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)
- Mapboxgl-Jupyter ([repo](https://github.com/mapbox/mapboxgl-jupyter), [demo](https://www.mapbox.com/labs/jupyter/))
- [Learn x in Y minutes, where X=python3](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/)
- [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

## Developing Jupyter Widgets
- [Interactive Widgets (demo)](http://jupyter.org/widgets)
- [Creating a Jupyter Widget](http://kazuar.github.io/jupyter-widget-tutorial/)
- [Widget-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-cookiecutter)

## Mapping
- [Getting Started on Geospatial Analysis with Python, GeoJSON and GeoPandas](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/geospatial-analysis-python-geojson-geopandas.html)
- [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/)
- [Intro to PostGIS](http://workshops.boundlessgeo.com/postgis-intro/)

## Containerized Jupyter
- [docker-stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks)
- [JupyterHub for OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/jupyterhub-quickstart)

## User Experience
- [Mapbrief](http://mapbrief.com/) - In particular, see [How the Public Actually Uses Local Government Web Maps](http://mapbrief.com/2012/08/01/how-the-public-actually-uses-local-government-web-maps-metrics-from-denver/)
- [Why does Data Vis need a style guide?](https://youtu.be/0rQ0NP8JPHQ) (video) - See also the [transcript](http://www.openvisconf.com/files/transcripts/OpenVis_Amy_Cesal.txt) for this video.

## Code Quality & Testing
- [Testing Jupyter Notebooks](https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2016/06/testing-jupyter-notebooks/)

## Next Steps & Inspiration
- [A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks)
- [OpenVis Conf](http://www.openvisconf.com/) - See videos from past conferences ([2017](http://www.openvisconf.com/2017) - [2013](http://www.openvisconf.com/2013)).
