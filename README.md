# From JavaScript to Jupyter
Here are resources that Iâ€™m using to learn Jupyter, data science, mapping, and Jupyter widget development.

## Data Science & Jupyter Foundations
- [Getting Started With Jupyter Notebook for Python](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)
- Mapboxgl-Jupyter ([repo](https://github.com/mapbox/mapboxgl-jupyter), [demo](https://www.mapbox.com/labs/jupyter/))
- [Intro to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

## Developing Jupyter Widgets
- [Interactive Widgets (demo)](http://jupyter.org/widgets)
- [Creating a Jupyter Widget](http://kazuar.github.io/jupyter-widget-tutorial/)
- [Widget-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-cookiecutter)

## Mapping
- [Getting Started on Geospatial Analysis with Python, GeoJSON and GeoPandas](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/geospatial-analysis-python-geojson-geopandas.html)
- [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/)

## Containerized Jupyter
- [docker-stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks)
- [JupyterHub for OpenShift](https://github.com/jupyter-on-openshift/jupyterhub-quickstart)
